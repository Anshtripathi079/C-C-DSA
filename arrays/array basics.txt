subarray = countinous part of the array
no. of subarrays in an array with n elements = nC2(combination wala)+n=n*(n+1)/2
subsequence = a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting zero or more elements , without changing the order of the remaining elements.
no. of subsequence in a array = 2^n
every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray.
